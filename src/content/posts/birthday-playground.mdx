## ...Going interactive

After my previous post about [birthday distribution in Armenia](/posts/first-post), I've decided to build an interactive chart. 
My initial attempt with Python's Plotly proved difficult for range interactivity, so I pivoted to D3.js. After data cleanup, I found a suitable D3.js example and built upon it.

One of the main reasons for this ineractive chart (excpet building interactive chart sounded fun) was to explore the phenomenon of birthday spikes on the 1st, 10th, 15th, and 20th of each. The chart clearly shows these spikes largely disappear after around 1970-1975, with the majority of births subsequently falling on earlier dates.

(Attention: The chart works best on desktop only. Workin on it.)
